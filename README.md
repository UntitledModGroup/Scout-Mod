# Scout Releaded
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/scoutreloaded)

A mod focused on "physically" extending the inventory (adding slots) through wearing various types of bags. Heavily inspired by makamys' [Satchels](https://github.com/makamys/Satchels).

Items are retained on the bag items themselves. The bag items are equipped through [Trinkets](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets) slots. A new slot type for pouches is added, with two slots.

## Future Plans
- [x] Fixing Repository gradle repos
- [x] Splitting up versions based on branches
- [x] Getting a build from this repo
- [ ] Satchel renders on the wearer (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Updating to 1.20.1

## Credits
* makamys - Original inspiration from Satchels
* Emi - Trinkets
* Kat - Original pouch texture, taken from an older mod of mine and reworked for Scout
* CadIndie - Inital Gradle Updates
* UTMG - Upgrading original source, (Reloaded Edition)

## How to build?
Easy. Just build like every other gradle project.

## Intentions
My intentions are to keep this mod alive, I wish to update and add features later on.

## No Forge plans still?
No. after rethinking and seeing, it would be better overall to make it from scratch for Forge due to the difference in "Trinket" mods. Forge uses Curios, where Fabric uses Trinkets.
