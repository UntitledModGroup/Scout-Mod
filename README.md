# Scout
A mod focused on "physically" extending the inventory (adding slots) through wearing various types of bags. Heavily inspired by makamys' [Satchels](https://github.com/makamys/Satchels).

Items are retained on the bag items themselves. The bag items are equipped through [Trinkets](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets) slots. A new slot type for pouches is added, with two slots.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Satchel renders on the wearer
~~- [x] Tooltip preview of items inside bags~~

## Forge?
A Forge version is not planned. You are free to port it, but I will not endorse it.
